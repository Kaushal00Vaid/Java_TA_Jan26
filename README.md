## 📅 How to Navigate Sessions Using Commit History

Each session is saved as a separate commit using the following format:

```
Session X - DD Mon
```

Example:

```
Session 1 - 12 Dec
Session 2 - 19 Dec
```

### Viewing Code from a Specific Session

You can browse past sessions using GitHub’s commit history:

1. Open the repository on GitHub
2. Click **Commits**
3. Select the commit labeled with the session you want
4. Browse or download the code snapshot from that session

This allows you to review exactly what was covered during each TA session.

## ▶️ How to Compile and Run Java Programs

This repository contains **only `.java` source files**.

No `.class` files are included, so you must compile them yourself.

### Compile a Java file

```
javac ClassName.java
```

### Run the compiled program

```
java ClassName
```

> ⚠️ Do **not** include `.java` when running the program.

### Example

```
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld
```

## How I Suggest You Use This Repository

This repository is not just for reading — it’s for **active practice**.

> **Turn off all AI Assistance** in your IDE.

- First, **get the source code** onto your machine and run it yourself.
- Then **get your hands dirty** — try different approaches, rewrite parts of the code, and experiment.
- Make small changes and **observe what happens** when you compile and run.
- Break things on purpose and fix them — that’s how real learning happens.
- Most importantly: **practice, practice, and practice**.

Treat this repo as a playground to explore Java concepts, not just as reference material.

## 💡 Tips for Working with the Repository

- Pull updates regularly to stay in sync with session content
- Use commit history to review past lessons
- Try modifying and experimenting with the code
- Keep notes on concepts demonstrated in each session

## 📌 Notes

- Code is organized by session where applicable
- Feel free to explore and experiment
- Ask questions during TA sessions if anything is unclear
